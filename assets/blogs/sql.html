    <h1 class="text-center p-5"> Exploring PL/SQL Blocks: Enhancing Database Functionality</h1>
    <div class="container">
        <p class="m-b-30">In the realm of database management and development, PL/SQL (Procedural Language/Structured Query Language)
            plays a crucial role in enhancing the functionality and performance of Oracle databases. Whether you're a
            seasoned developer or just delving into the world of database programming, understanding PL/SQL blocks is
            essential for leveraging Oracle's capabilities effectively.</p>

            <h3 class="m-b-15">What are PL/SQL Blocks?</h3>

            <p class="m-b-30">PL/SQL blocks are fundamental units of code that can include declarations, assignments, control structures, and other procedural constructs. These blocks are executed as a unit, allowing developers to encapsulate logic and manipulate data within Oracle databases.</p>

            </h3>

            <p class="m-b-15">A typical PL/SQL block consists of three main parts:</p>
            <p class="m-b-15"><strong>1. Declaration Section:</strong> This section defines variables, cursors, constants, and other elements used within the block.</p>

            <p class="m-b-15"><strong>2. Executable Section: </strong> This part contains the procedural code that performs actions such as data manipulation, querying, or control flow operations.</p>

            <p class="m-b-15"><strong>3. Exception Handling Section: </strong> Optionally, developers can include error-handling code to manage exceptions that may occur during the execution of the block.</p>
